# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation ML Project — Cohort A3 Group 01

**Course**: AI Engineering Track (Machine Learning Module)  
**Instructor**: Hozaifa Moustafa (Arabian Academy)  
**Group**: `a3-g01` (Cohort A3 — Tue/Sat)  
**Notebook**: [`customer_segmentation.ipynb`](customer_segmentation.ipynb)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project transforms 1 year of raw retail transaction logs (`3,663` transactions across `300` unique customers from Jan 1 to Dec 30, 2024) into actionable customer segments using unsupervised machine learning.

### Pipeline Highlights
1. **Data Quality & EDA**: Complete validation (0 nulls, date/amount sanity, multi-purchase analysis, category balance).
2. **RFM Feature Engineering**: Customer-level aggregation of Recency ($R$), Frequency ($F$), and Monetary ($M$) using baseline date `2024-12-31`.
3. **Skewness & Scaling**: Right-skewness reduction via `np.log1p` and feature standardization via `StandardScaler`.
4. **Optimal $k$ Evaluation**: Multi-metric sweep $k \in [2, 8]$ using Elbow Method (WCSS), Silhouette Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index justifying optimal **$k=4$**.
5. **K-Means & PCA 2D Reduction**: Model fitting with `KMeans(k=4, random_state=42)` and PCA projection retaining **99.53% explained variance** with annotated centroids.
6. **Personas & Business Strategy**: 4 named customer personas grounded in unscaled RFM profile metrics with targeted strategic recommendations.
